This is a standalone example that demonstrates a very simple RestLi
client and server. The code and logic behind it is described in detail
in:

https://github.com/linkedin/pegasus/wiki/Quickstart:-A-Tutorial-Introduction-to-RestLi

To build, use gradle 1.3 or greater, execute the following at the top level:

gradle build

You can then run the server with:

gradle JettyRunWar

Once running, you can send a GET request to the server with:

curl -v http://localhost:8080/server/fortunes/1

or run the client with

gradle startFortunesClient
